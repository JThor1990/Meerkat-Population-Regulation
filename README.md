# Environmental change and population regulation in Kalahari meerkats

The R code and data sets in the repository can be used to replicate the analyses in our paper "_Environmental change and population regulation in Kalahari meerkats_". The aim of the study was to explore the relative impact of variation in rainfall and temperature on the demography of meerkats, a cooperatively breeding mongoose that lives in the semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The analyses are split into four distinct R scripts.  
  
(1) Analysis 1 - Climate and vegetation productivity trends and relationships.R  
(2) Analysis 2 - Trends in demographic parameters and adult body mass.R  
(3) Analysis 3 - Effects of climate on demographic parameters.R  
(4) Analysis 4 - Group extinctions.R

  All data sets are also contained within the folder. Column headers should be pretty self-explanatory and follow the descriptions provided in the paper's materials and methods. If you would also like further information on other aspects of the paper, including additional code that I used to generate the datasets (e.g. climate data, SIV of NDVI, home range sensitivity analyses) then you can email me directly at jackthorley1@gmail.com or jbt27@cam.ac.uk.
